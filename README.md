# Cryptic - Website

## Welcome

This is the open-source source code to the official website of cryptic-game.

We develop an open source hacking browser game. This started as a community project of the Youtuber https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMorpheus407. You can already test a first pre-release of the game at https://play.cryptic-game.net/login. Feel free to explore our other repositories at https://github.com/cryptic-game.

## For Developers

To help us create this project, you can clone the repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/cryptic-game/website.git`

You can easily host the website yourself with docker.

just `cd website/` and run

`$ docker build -t cryptic-website:latest .`

with the created nginx based docker image
you can now run a docker container
you should map port 80 for nginx:

```
$ docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules -d -p 8080:3000 cryptic-website:latest
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
